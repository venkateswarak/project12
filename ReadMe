Project Documentation.

  After looking at the IRS data given we thought there would be some relation to mortgages paid and the location they are from.
For example in states like California where housing is costly people would have to pay higher mortgages when compared to other
states like Arizona. We tried to extract this information from the data. 

Data Source 
  IRS returns data was used for this project.
Cleaning & modelling Data
  IRS data contained lot of data. We were interested in number of returns, state, agi, mortgages.
  Pandas handled null's and other issues in data.
  Data was remodeled to and a new column was added to data frame called ppm percapita mortgage interest payed.
  ppm = total mortgage paid/total returns
Clustering
  The data was clustered into 3 clusters using k-means clustering algorithm
  3 clusters were selected because the graphs of data showed a roughly into 3 groups
Data Representation
  Matplot lob was used to represent data.
  x- axis is Agi
  y axis is ppm
  Each cluster has a colour 
  and each point in the graph is a state.
  
Conclusion 
  As mentioned California is in a cluster which has more ppm Arizona is in 
  the middle and North Dakota is part of the cluster which has least ppm
